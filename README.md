## Projects where complex behavior emerges from simple rules.


**Projects** (In order of decreasing elegance):

  Boids- Simulates flocking patterns using [3 simple rules](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/2008-09/modeling-natural-systems/boids.html). Uses quad tree optimization for speed. Interactive tuning of parameters and obstacles implemented.
  
  Conway's Game of Life- Interactive implemention of [Conway's Game of Life](http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~lipa/mec/lesson6.html). Allows for running of starting configurations or interactively stepping through patterns.
  
  Epidemic Simulation- Uses simple proximity rules to show how an epidemic progresses and the effect of public health measures like social distancing and quarantines. Parameters can be changed to observe how different variables effect the epidemic. Simulation statistics displayed in run time. Uses quad tree optimization for speed. Inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxAaO2rsdIs).
  
  Gravity- Complex patterns of orbits arise from [the law of Gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation). A solar system-like configuration is default but can be changed.
  
  Chaos Equations- Simple nonautonomous differential equations give rise to complex patterns. Inspired by [CodeParade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDSIRXmnVvk).
  
  Particle Life- Create self organizing cell like structures with random attraction generator. Not yet completed.
